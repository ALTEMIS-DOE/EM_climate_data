Overview

This folder includes the climate datasets (historical/projection) and visualization for the 8 DOE-EM sites that were deemed to have some level of potential risk associated with future climate change in terms of altering system performance and/or exceeding design requirements. We use the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) climate models (Taylor et al., 2012), which are the standard global climate model ensembles used in the US Global Change Research Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both historical and future projection datasets (Thrasher et al., 2012) are downscaled to 28 km (0.25 degree) from the coarser 1-degree resolution GCM output. 

We define the risk score based on the historical mean, projected mean, and historical standard deviation, when the climate metrics follow a statistically normal distribution, following the approach of Werth (2016). When the distribution is skewed, we define the risk score based on the distribution quantile.
